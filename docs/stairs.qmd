## Content

The workshop will first introduce the main spatial data models (vector: points/lines/polygons; raster: various grid types), their implementation in file formats and software libraries to read and write them. It will then introduce time series associated with such models (NetCDF, Zarr, CDL, CF conventions) and discuss APIs for retrieving satellite, weather and climate data.

### Vector data

### Raster data

### Time series

### Data cubes
